## Introduction

As a front-end developer, Iâ€™ve always focused on building great user interfaces, but recently, Iâ€™ve been diving deeper into server management and deployment. In this blog, Iâ€™ll share my personal experience setting up WordPress on an Nginx server with SSL, a journey that has helped me understand web hosting, security, and performance optimization.

## Why I Chose This Setup

I wanted a reliable and secure setup for hosting WordPress sites, and after researching, I decided to use:

- **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** for stability and security
- **Nginx** for better performance compared to Apache
- **SSL (Letâ€™s Encrypt)** for security and HTTPS support

This combination ensures that my WordPress sites are fast, secure, and scalable.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Setting Up the Server

I started by updating my system and installing necessary packages:

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Then, I installed PHP, Nginx, and MySQL:

```sh
sudo apt install -y nginx mysql-server php-fpm php-mysql
```

This provided the foundation for running WordPress.

### 2. Installing and Configuring WordPress

I downloaded and extracted WordPress:

```sh
wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar -xvzf latest.tar.gz
sudo mv wordpress /var/www/wordpress
```

I set the correct file permissions:

```sh
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/wordpress/
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/wordpress/
```

### 3. Setting Up the Database

Using MySQL, I created a new database and user:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE wordpress_db;
CREATE USER 'wordpress_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'securepassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress_db.* TO 'wordpress_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### 4. Configuring Nginx

I configured Nginx to serve WordPress efficiently. I edited the configuration file:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/wordpress
```

Added the following configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    root /var/www/wordpress;
    index index.php index.html index.htm;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

After saving, I enabled the configuration and restarted Nginx:

```sh
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/wordpress /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### 5. Enabling SSL with Letâ€™s Encrypt

To secure the site with HTTPS, I installed Certbot:

```sh
sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
sudo snap install --classic certbot
```

I obtained an SSL certificate and configured Nginx:

```sh
sudo certbot --nginx -d example.com -d www.example.com
```

To ensure automatic renewal:

```sh
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

## Lessons Learned

- **File Permissions Matter**: WordPress wonâ€™t work correctly if permissions are wrong.
- **Database Security Is Important**: Using a secure password and restricting privileges is crucial.
- **Nginx Configuration Can Be Tricky**: Testing with `nginx -t` before restarting saved me a lot of debugging time.
- **SSL Is a Must**: Modern websites need HTTPS for security and SEO benefits.

## Conclusion

Setting up WordPress with Nginx and SSL was a rewarding experience. Not only did it help me understand backend technologies, but it also made me appreciate the work that goes into web hosting and security. I hope this guide helps anyone looking to set up their own WordPress site with a strong, secure foundation.

This is just the beginningâ€”next, I plan to explore performance optimizations and caching strategies. Stay tuned! ðŸš€
