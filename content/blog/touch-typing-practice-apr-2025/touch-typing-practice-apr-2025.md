## ðŸš€ Update Process

Today is April 13th, 2025. Iâ€™m writing this blog to update my touch typing practice journey for this month. As of today, Iâ€™ve maintained a **168-day streak** on MonkeyType. Itâ€™s been a long road, and Iâ€™m genuinely proud of myself for staying consistent and tracking every step of the way.

This month, I hit **two new personal records**, and Iâ€™m super excited to share them with you!

Over the past few weeks, Iâ€™ve increased my daily practice time to **25 minutes per day**, switching between 15s and 60s sessions. I mentioned this change in my previous update. However, even after dedicating more time, I started to feel like my results werenâ€™t improving much. That made me feel a bit down.

When I checked the weekly leaderboard, I saw some users with over **450 hours of practice** still typing around 60 WPM, and others with **400â€“500 hours** at about 100 WPM. It reminded me that I started this journey without a clear goal. I didnâ€™t have any friends to practice with or share progress, and honestly, I didnâ€™t even know why I was doing it at first.

When Iâ€™m coding, I donâ€™t use my maximum typing speed â€” not 100 WPM, not even 80 or 90. Programming requires thinking and planning, not just speed. Iâ€™ve also noticed that the faster I try to go, the more mistakes I make. That really got me thinking.

Looking at my distribution, my 90â€“100 WPM range puts me in the top 20% of users. But I donâ€™t aim to be the best. I just want to be a good, steady developer.

## ðŸ”œ Upcoming Changes

Moving forward, my goal is simple: **do 1% better than yesterday** â€” even on tough days when I donâ€™t feel motivated. Iâ€™ve decided to **reduce my typing practice to around 10 minutes per day**. Iâ€™ll use the extra time to focus on other goals I care about.

During typing sessions, Iâ€™ll **prioritize accuracy over speed**. In fact, both records I broke this month happened when I consciously slowed down and focused on precision instead of rushing.
