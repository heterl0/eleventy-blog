## 🚀 Update Process

Today is March 16, 2025—approximately one month since [my last update](../touch-typing-practice-feb-2025). Initially, I didn't notice significant improvements in my typing skills, so I decided to increase my daily practice time from 10 minutes to 25 minutes. This adjustment helped accelerate my progress and resulted in new personal records:

- **Average Typing Speed:** Improved to around **88–90 WPM** for the 15-second tests.
    
- **New Personal Best (15s test):** Achieved a record of **116 WPM** 🎉.
    
- **New Personal Best (10-word test):** Reached an impressive **143 WPM** 🎯.

These results are encouraging and validate the effectiveness of increasing my daily practice time.

## 🎯 My Approach

## ⏳ Increasing Daily Typing Time

By practicing 25 minutes daily, I accumulate approximately **750 minutes (12.5 hours)** per month. Although this increase is beneficial, it's difficult to precisely measure its impact due to various influencing factors:

- My mood during practice sessions 😊
    
- Fatigue levels after work 💤
    
- Physical comfort and hand condition ✋
    

Because these factors vary daily, it's challenging to pinpoint exactly how much each contributes to my performance. Thus, I've decided to rely on the average WPM as a reliable indicator of improvement.

I trust in the principle of Normal Distribution 📊—most of my typing tests consistently fall within the **80–90 WPM** range, indicating that my true average is approximately **88 WPM**. This measurement feels accurate and reasonable.

## 🛠️ Using Monkeytype Logger Error Extension

To further refine my typing accuracy, I created a custom browser extension called [**Monkeytype Logger Error**](../monkeytype-extension-logger-error), which tracks and analyzes typing errors. This tool helps me identify problematic characters and words that frequently cause mistakes.

Here's how you can use it:

1. Install the extension from the [Microsoft Store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/monkeytype-history-logger/ophgnpohledibffckhpabdcciniinnjo).
    
2. On [Monkeytype.com](https://monkeytype.com/), navigate to Settings:
    
    - Under `Behavior`, enable `Always show words history`.
        
3. Start typing! Your errors will be logged automatically.
    
4. After your session, export your error data by clicking the `Download JSON` button.
    

Next, visit the [MonkeyType Analysis](https://monkeytype-analysis.heterl0.live/) website and import your JSON file. The website will analyze your data and highlight frequent mistakes.

I then use ChatGPT to generate customized typing exercises based on these common errors, helping me target specific weaknesses more effectively.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Remember to turn off `Always show words history` when practicing custom texts to avoid data loops in your error logs.

## 🔄 Alternating Between 15s and 60s Tests

Recently, I adopted a new training strategy: alternating daily between short (15-second) and longer (60-second) typing tests. Each test type offers unique benefits:

- **15-second tests:** Boost initial speed bursts ⚡️, improve accuracy early on, and reduce immediate errors.
    
- **60-second tests:** Enhance typing endurance 🏃‍♂️, stability, and consistency—skills crucial for real-world tasks like coding or writing documentation.
    

I discovered that these two test types complement each other perfectly, creating a balanced improvement in both speed and endurance.

## 🎖️ Conclusion & Next Steps

This month's adjustments yielded noticeable improvements and new personal records—small victories that motivate me to continue this enjoyable journey toward mastering typing skills. My ultimate goal remains: achieving an average overall speed of **100 WPM** 🚩.

Tracking progress through these blogs makes this journey fun and meaningful for me—not just for practical purposes but as a personal challenge. Stay tuned for future updates!
